# Probabilty Distributions calculator

## Why?

Because the calculators recommended by the professor are __completely functional__
but lack a modern UI... or at least one that I personally like. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
Also, I wanted to practice more TypeScript.

## Contributions

The idea behind this project is to create a calculator for all sort of Probability Distribution models, so if there is one that you particularly want to add, feel free to contribute. üòé
